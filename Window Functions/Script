--Suppose you want to determine the total salary of all the employees in the company
use Northwind
select sum(salary) as total_salary from Employees

--How about determining the total salary of employees per job category? 
select job_description , sum(salary) as total_salary  from Employees group by job_description

--to display the total salary of employees along with every row value
--window_function_name(<expression>) OVER ( )
select *, sum(salary)  OVER() as total_salary from employees 

--to display the total salary per job category for all the rows
--window_function_name(<expression>) OVER (<partition_by_clause>)
select *, sum(salary)  OVER(PARTITION BY job_description)  as total_job_salary  from employees

--to display the total salary per job category, ordered by olders employess per HireDate for all the rows
--window_function_name(<expression>) OVER (<partition_by_clause> <order_clause>)
select *, sum(salary)  OVER(PARTITION BY job_description order by HireDate asc)  as total_job_salary  from employees

--Sometimes your dataset might not have a column depicting the sequential order of the rows, 
--as is the case with our dataset. In that case, we can make use of the ROW_NUMBER() window function. 
--It assigns a unique sequential number to each row of the table.
select *, ROW_NUMBER() over (PARTITION BY job_description ORDER BY EmployeeID) as "row_number" from employees

--The RANK() window function, as the name suggests, ranks the rows within their partition based on the given condition
select *, 
ROW_NUMBER() over (PARTITION BY job_description ORDER BY salary) as "row_number" ,
RANK() over (PARTITION BY job_description ORDER BY salary) as "rank_row"
from employees

--The DENSE_RANK() function is similar to the RANK() except for one difference, it doesn’t skip any ranks when ranking rows.
select *, 
ROW_NUMBER() over (PARTITION BY job_description ORDER BY salary) as "row_number" ,
RANK() over (PARTITION BY job_description ORDER BY salary) as "rank_row",
DENSE_RANK() over (PARTITION BY job_description ORDER BY salary) as "dense_rank"
from employees
